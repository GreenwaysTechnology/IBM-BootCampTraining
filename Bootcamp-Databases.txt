What is database?
  Collection of data stored in disk / in memory.

How to store data in computers?

=>file system
    Where information is stored

1960s program languages started coming to access the file and process file, prepare reports out of that.

eg:
 bank stores information about their customers and deposits and withdraws

1.bank asks who has deposited big amount today.
 Application developer writes code, process the file and gets data.
2.bank asks who has deposited big amount for this month
  Application developer writes code, process the file and gets data.


EF.Code who invented Realtion model for data storage and process based on realtional algeriabra.
Based on EF Code rule R Database management system was designed

Code Rules

1.
Rule 0: The foundation rule:

For any system that is advertised as, or claimed to be, a relational data base management system, that system must be able to manage data bases entirely through its relational capabilities.

Rule 1: The information rule:

All information in a relational data base is represented explicitly at the logical level and in exactly one way â€“ by values in tables(Row-value)


Rule 2: The guaranteed access rule:

 Each and every datum (atomic value) in a relational data base is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name.

Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values:

Null values (distinct from the empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct from zero or any other number) are supported in fully relational DBMS for representing missing information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of data type.

Rule 4: Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model:

The data base description is represented at the logical level in the same way as ordinary data, so that authorized users can apply the same relational language to its interrogation as they apply to the regular data.

Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage rule:

Rule 6:
 A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:

Data definition.
View definition.
Data manipulation (interactive and by program).
Integrity constraints.
Authorization.
Transaction boundaries (begin, commit and rollback).

Rule 6: The view updating rule:

All views that are theoretically updatable are also updatable by the system.


Rule 7: Possible for high-level insert, update, and delete:

The capability of handling a base relation or a derived relation as a single operand applies not only to the retrieval of data but also to the insertion, update and deletion of data.

Rule 8: Physical data independence:

Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired whenever any changes are made in either storage representations or access methods.


Rule 9: Logical data independence:

Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information-preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment are made to the base tables.

Rule 10: Integrity independence:

Integrity constraints specific to a particular relational data base must be definable in the relational data sublanguage and storable in the catalog, not in the application programs.

Rule 11: Distribution independence:

The end-user must not be able to see that the data is distributed over various locations. Users should always get the impression that the data is located at one site only.

Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule:

If a relational system has a low-level (single-record-at-a-time) language, that low level cannot be used to subvert or bypass the integrity rules and constraints expressed in the higher level relational language (multiple-records-at-a-time).

.............................................................................................

Based on EF codd only, all relational databases were designed.

Databases:

1.IBM DB2
2.Oracle
3.Microsoft SQL server
4.MySql
5.POSTGRE
etc....
...................................................................................
				Brith of NOSQL
....................................................................................
NOSQL databases are more popular now a database
Mongodb
Redis
casendra
etc...

...........................................................................................
				 RealtionalDatabase

if you take any relational database, which is simply software only written either c or c++ ,java,javascript,python..

Every relational database internally uses file system to store data.

.............................................................................................
.............................................................................................
				   SEQL  -SQL

Structured English Query Language,Structured Query language, is programming language created by IBM in order to save,process data using commands
..............................................................................................
SQL language is common for the most of the database implemenations, but some extra commands or syntax for database to database may vary.
.............................................................................................
.....................................................................................
                      Database Design based on problem space /application domain
.....................................................................................

What is data models:

  Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

The very first data model could be flat data-models, where all the data used are to be kept in the same plane. Earlier data models were not so scientific, hence they were prone to introduce lots of duplication and update anomalies.

What is Normalization?
     In oo we call abstraction.
  
    Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. 

   Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.

				Database schema
...........................................................................................

MySql is database software, can host many databases (schema) - plan
Schema is container object in database which contains other things
.....................................................................................
				 Database Objects


1.Schema
   Container Object which other objects
2.Table
    Object which stores data in row...column order
3.Views
4.Index
5.Stored Procedure
6.trigger 
etc...

What is MySQL?

Before MySQL all enterprise databases were not free like oracle,db2,microsoft sql server.
due to this many open source projects affected, The developer who is Michael, who started developing enterprise open source relational database called "MySql".

Later MySQL was acquired by Oracle,Oracle would said, MySQL continue in open source only ,if you  want for cost, we can offer enterprise support.

SQL basics :

SQL Quries are classified into three category

1.DDL
2.DML
3.DCL/TCL

Data definition Language:

CREATE
ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE
COMMENT
RENAME
