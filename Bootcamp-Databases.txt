What is database?
  Collection of data stored in disk / in memory.

How to store data in computers?

=>file system
    Where information is stored

1960s program languages started coming to access the file and process file, prepare reports out of that.

eg:
 bank stores information about their customers and deposits and withdraws

1.bank asks who has deposited big amount today.
 Application developer writes code, process the file and gets data.
2.bank asks who has deposited big amount for this month
  Application developer writes code, process the file and gets data.


EF.Code who invented Realtion model for data storage and process based on realtional algeriabra.
Based on EF Code rule R Database management system was designed

Code Rules

1.
Rule 0: The foundation rule:

For any system that is advertised as, or claimed to be, a relational data base management system, that system must be able to manage data bases entirely through its relational capabilities.

Rule 1: The information rule:

All information in a relational data base is represented explicitly at the logical level and in exactly one way – by values in tables(Row-value)


Rule 2: The guaranteed access rule:

 Each and every datum (atomic value) in a relational data base is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name.

Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values:

Null values (distinct from the empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct from zero or any other number) are supported in fully relational DBMS for representing missing information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of data type.

Rule 4: Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model:

The data base description is represented at the logical level in the same way as ordinary data, so that authorized users can apply the same relational language to its interrogation as they apply to the regular data.

Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage rule:

Rule 6:
 A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:

Data definition.
View definition.
Data manipulation (interactive and by program).
Integrity constraints.
Authorization.
Transaction boundaries (begin, commit and rollback).

Rule 6: The view updating rule:

All views that are theoretically updatable are also updatable by the system.


Rule 7: Possible for high-level insert, update, and delete:

The capability of handling a base relation or a derived relation as a single operand applies not only to the retrieval of data but also to the insertion, update and deletion of data.

Rule 8: Physical data independence:

Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired whenever any changes are made in either storage representations or access methods.


Rule 9: Logical data independence:

Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information-preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment are made to the base tables.

Rule 10: Integrity independence:

Integrity constraints specific to a particular relational data base must be definable in the relational data sublanguage and storable in the catalog, not in the application programs.

Rule 11: Distribution independence:

The end-user must not be able to see that the data is distributed over various locations. Users should always get the impression that the data is located at one site only.

Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule:

If a relational system has a low-level (single-record-at-a-time) language, that low level cannot be used to subvert or bypass the integrity rules and constraints expressed in the higher level relational language (multiple-records-at-a-time).

.............................................................................................

Based on EF codd only, all relational databases were designed.

Databases:

1.IBM DB2
2.Oracle
3.Microsoft SQL server
4.MySql
5.POSTGRE
etc....
...................................................................................
				Brith of NOSQL
....................................................................................
NOSQL databases are more popular now a database
Mongodb
Redis
casendra
etc...

...........................................................................................
				 RealtionalDatabase

if you take any relational database, which is simply software only written either c or c++ ,java,javascript,python..

Every relational database internally uses file system to store data.

.............................................................................................
.............................................................................................
				   SEQL  -SQL

Structured English Query Language,Structured Query language, is programming language created by IBM in order to save,process data using commands
..............................................................................................
SQL language is common for the most of the database implemenations, but some extra commands or syntax for database to database may vary.
.............................................................................................
.....................................................................................
                      Database Design based on problem space /application domain
.....................................................................................

What is data models:

  Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

The very first data model could be flat data-models, where all the data used are to be kept in the same plane. Earlier data models were not so scientific, hence they were prone to introduce lots of duplication and update anomalies.

What is Normalization?
     In oo we call abstraction.
  
    Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. 

   Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.

				Database schema
...........................................................................................

MySql is database software, can host many databases (schema) - plan
Schema is container object in database which contains other things
.....................................................................................
				 Database Objects


1.Schema
   Container Object which other objects
2.Table
    Object which stores data in row...column order
3.Views
4.Index
5.Stored Procedure
6.trigger 
etc...

..............................................................................................

What is MySQL?

Before MySQL all enterprise databases were not free like oracle,db2,microsoft sql server.
due to this many open source projects affected, The developer who is Michael, who started developing enterprise open source relational database called "MySql".

Later MySQL was acquired by Oracle,Oracle would said, MySQL continue in open source only ,if you  want for cost, we can offer enterprise support.

CREATE command is used to create any database objects

schema,table,view,storedProcedure.....


create table:

CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
) ENGINE=storage_engine;

 The IF NOT EXISTS is optional. It allows you to check if the table that you create already exists in the database

you specify a list of columns of the table in the column_list section, columns are separated by commas.

Column defintions:

column_name data_type(length) [NOT NULL] [DEFAULT value] [AUTO_INCREMENT] column_constraint;



The column_name specifies the name of the column. 

Each column has a specific data type and optional size e.g.,VARCHAR(255) 


The  NOT NULL constraint ensures that the column will not contain NULL.

Besides the NOT NULL constraint, a column may have additional constraint such as CHECK, and UNIQUE.

The DEFAULT specifies a default value for the column.

The AUTO_INCREMENT  indicates that the value of the column is incremented by one automatically whenever a new row is inserted into the table.

Each table has a maximum one AUTO_INCREMENT column.


After the column list, you can define table constraints such as UNIQUE, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY.

Demo:

in order to create table we need schema.

How to create/drop schema

CREATE SCHEMA `sapient` ;
DROP DATABASE sapient

How to know the current database?

 SELECT database();

    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE,
    due_date DATE,
    status TINYINT NOT NULL,
    priority TINYINT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,

Constraints:
 Rules for table columns

NOT Null
UNIQUE 
Primary Key
Foreign Key
Default 
Check

NOT Null:
The NOT NULL constraint is a column constraint that ensures values stored in a column are not NULL.

The syntax of defining a NOT NULL constraint is as follows:

column_name data_type NOT NULL;

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE
);

DML: INSERT - to add single row into the table

INSERT INTO table(c1,c2,...) VALUES (v1,v2,...);

mysql> describe tasks
    -> ;
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |

ERROR 1364 (HY000): Field 'start_date' doesn't have a default value
mysql>
............................................................................................

UNIQUE Constraints:
...................
  in order to have unique values.

There are two ways to add constriant on columns

1.in the column defintion itself

CREATE TABLE table_name(
    ...,
    column_name data_type UNIQUE,
    ...
);

2.At end of the column list

CREATE TABLE table_name(
   ...
   column_name1 column_definition,
   column_name2 column_definition,
   ...,
   UNIQUE(column_name1,column_name2)
);

With help of constraint command

[CONSTRAINT constraint_name] UNIQUE(column_list)

Example :
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    supplier_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (supplier_id),
    CONSTRAINT uc_name_address UNIQUE (name , address)
);
 describe suppliers;
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field       | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| supplier_id | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name        | varchar(255) | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
| phone       | varchar(15)  | NO   | UNI | NULL    |                |
| address     | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO suppliers(name,phone,address) VALUES('abc','100','city');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO suppliers(name,phone,address) VALUES('abcd','100','scity');
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '100' for key 'suppliers.phone'
mysql>
.............................................................................................

PRIMARY Key Constriant

PrimaryKey = not null + unquie


1.A primary key must contain unique values. 
2.If the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.
3.A primary key column cannot have NULL values.
4.Any attempt to insert or update NULL to primary key columns will result in an error.
 "Note that MySQL implicitly adds a NOT NULL constraint to primary key columns."
5.A table can have one an only one primary key.
6.Primary keys would be mostly sno...A primary key column often has the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute that automatically generates a sequential integer whenever you insert a new row into the table.

There are two ways to add constriant on columns

1.in the column defintion itself


CREATE TABLE table_name(
    primary_key_column datatype PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);

2.At end of the column list

CREATE TABLE table_name(
    primary_key_column1 datatype,
    primary_key_column2 datatype,
    ...,
    PRIMARY KEY(column_list)
);

eg:
CREATE TABLE roles(
   role_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
   role_name VARCHAR(50),
   PRIMARY KEY(role_id)
);
INSERT INTO roles(role_name) VALUES('Manager');

			Constriants across the tables(Related tables only)
............................................................................................
foreign key:

  A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a table that links to a column or group of columns in another table. 

The foreign key places constraints on data in the related tables, which allows MySQL to maintain "referential integrity".

[CONSTRAINT constraint_name]
FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (column_name, ...)
REFERENCES parent_table(colunm_name,...)
[ON DELETE reference_option]
[ON UPDATE reference_option]

MySQL has five reference options: CASCADE, SET NULL, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET DEFAULT.

CASCADE: if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the matching rows in the child table automatically deleted or updated.

SET NULL:  if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the foreign key column (or columns) in the child table are set to NULL.

RESTRICT:  if a row from the parent table has a matching row in the child table, MySQL rejects deleting or updating rows in the parent table.

NO ACTION: is the same as RESTRICT.

SET DEFAULT: is recognized by the MySQL parser. However, this action is rejected by both InnoDB and NDB tables.

    categoryId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

			Database objects


1.index
2.views
3.storedprocedures and functions
4.tiggers
5.transactions

index:
 index is object used on table columns used to perform fast data reterival.
 An index is a data structure such as B-Tree that improves the speed of data retrieval on a table at the cost of additional writes and storage to maintain it.


how to add index?

inside table definition

CREATE TABLE t(
   c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
   c2 INT NOT NULL,
   c3 INT NOT NULL,
   c4 VARCHAR(10),
   INDEX (c2,c3) 
);

outside table definition:

 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_list)


Views:

  Views are like table, but can be used only query reterival.

Why Views?

SELECT 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber, 
    paymentDate, 
    amount
FROM
    customers
INNER JOIN
    payments USING (customerNumber);

Views are used to abstract complex query operations?

CREATE VIEW viewName select statement;

CREATE VIEW customerPayments
AS 
SELECT 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber, 
    paymentDate, 
    amount
FROM
    customers
INNER JOIN
    payments USING (customerNumber);


SELECT *FROM customerPayments.
....................................................................................
Triggers:

In MySQL, a trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, update, or delete that occurs in the associated table. 

MySQL supports triggers that are invoked in response to the INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE event.

The SQL standard defines two types of triggers:

row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.

A row-level trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted.  For example, if a table has 100 rows inserted, updated, or deleted, the trigger is automatically invoked 100 times for the 100 rows affected.

A statement-level trigger is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

Advantages of triggers
Triggers provide another way to check the integrity of data.
Triggers handle errors from the database layer.
Triggers give an alternative way to run scheduled tasks. By using triggers, you don’t have to wait for the scheduled events to run because the triggers are invoked automatically before or after a change is made to the data in a table.
Triggers can be useful for auditing the data changes in tables.

How to create Trigger?

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE| DELETE }
ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
trigger_body;


CREATE TABLE employees_audit (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employeeNumber INT NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    changedat DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL
);

				   Trancations and Locks
..............................................................................................

What is transaction?
  A sequence of statement execution, during statement execution if something goes wrong in the middle, i dont want to continue the steps and cancel previous actions.

for eg:

				NO-SQL Databases
....................................................................................

What is the problem RDBMS?

1.Vendor lock-in
    once if you decide the storage model, you cant alter that.

For eg :
 you  create table having 3 columns
 after some time you want to add new column - In RDBMS it is not possible

2.fixed schema
  we can store only data in row column manner


The common characteristics of NoSQL databases are
• Not using the relational model
• Running well on clusters.
• Open-source
• Built for the 21st century web estates
• Schemaless

The most important result of the rise of NoSQL is Polyglot Persistence.

How to choose the right DB
=====================================================================================
When you have to decide on a NoSQL database for your project, following are the things you have to choose 

- Data Model 
- Distribution Model

===============================
Choice 1 - Data Models - How to store data
=====================================================================================

Different kind of data models in NoSQL are : 
- Key-Value
- Document 
- Column Family
- Graph 

Key-Value:
  Storing data using key values

id:1
redis

Document 
What is a Document Database?
A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) is a database that stores information in documents.

{
     "_id": 1,
     "first_name": "Tom",
     "email": "tom@example.com",
     "cell": "765-555-5555",
     "likes": [
        "fashion",
        "spas",
        "shopping"
     ],
     "businesses": [
        {
           "name": "Entertainment 1080",
           "partner": "Jean",
           "status": "Bankrupt",
           "date_founded": {
              "$date": "2012-05-19T04:00:00Z"
           }
        },
        {
           "name": "Swag for Tweens",
           "date_founded": {
              "$date": "2012-11-01T04:00:00Z"
           }
        }
     ]
  }

Mongo db:
  It is one of the most popular document database is Mongodb

Collections(like tables)
A collection is a group of documents. Collections typically store documents that have similar contents.

How to perform operations on Document Databases?

1.Create: Documents can be created in the database. Each document has a unique identifier.

2.Read: Documents can be read from the database. The API or query language allows developers to query for documents using their unique identifiers or field values. 

3.Indexes can be added to the database in order to increase read performance.

4.Update: Existing documents can be updated — either in whole or in part.
Delete: Documents can be deleted from the database.

Column Oriented Database:
  Stores data in the form of columns.

eg:
   Amazon Redshift

.....................................................................................
Graph Database:
  Stores data in the form tree model.

  A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it.
