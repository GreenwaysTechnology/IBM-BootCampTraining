What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is JVM framework to build distributed application.

What is Spring Framework?
 -Spring Framework makes it easy to create java Enterprise applications.

Early 2000, Java Started becoming more popular in distributed application dev.

Distributed Apps:
-Monolith Apps - legacy way of building apps
-MicroService Apps - modern way of way building apps

How Java  Works? Who Provides Java Standarization?

JCP - Java Community Process
 Who standarize the entire Java Technology.

Types of Java Tech

What is spec

JEE enterprise application:
............................

Client Layer         Web Layer      Biz layer      Data Layer/Persistency

Browser             Servlet/JSP      EJB               Entity Beans

EJB :Enterprise Java Bean
  Java Object can support distributed biz operations
eg: incase of shopping cart
  I have a bean(java object) which has three apis addToCart,Checkout,Payment)

Api classifications:
1.Session Bean  - to represent biz logic---jdbc--dml
2.Enitity bean  -ORM - Object to Table mapping-First orm solution---Hibernate
3.Message Driven Bean - Message driven systems-RabbitMQ,Kaffka,JMS



Rod  was working in enterprise banking application with jee, he faced lot of complexity in designing ejb driven systems, so he decided to move ejb from JEE application, he wrote book called expert  J2EE ONE ON ONE design and development.



He proposed a model  that model later on came as The project in "Spring Season" - Spring Framework.

Client Layer         Web Layer      Biz layer                Data Layer/Persistency

Browser             Spring MVC      Spring Services              Spring-orm - Spring-data

Spring development objective is "POJO". (Plain Old Java Object)

When you build enterprise java apps, no plumbing(bolier plate code),Spring framework takes care that plumbing.

				Enterprise application challanges
..............................................................................................

Java is Object Oriented Programming language.

Apps built on java collection of objects.

Object Oriented Principles:
...........................

1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Hierarchy
4.Typing
5.Modularity
----------------------
6.Concurrency
7.Persistency



1.Object Management :Hierarchy

Object Relationship

-HAS-A -  Composition
-IS-A - Inheritance.

Enterprise application challanges:

1.Object Management

IOC : Inversion of Control
 Inversion -Do opposit
 of Control -Management

In enterprise application object creation and linking objects are so complex that should be removed from the developer.

Someone should take care object creation and linking= 
  =>This process is called as IOC.
The IOC suggest the automation program,that program called as IOC Container.

The first IOC Container
1.PICO Container
2.Spring container : It was born as enterprise container.

Spring container takes care of object creations and object linking .
Which is other wise called as "Dependency Injection" .
 Dependency - HAS-A
    injection - linking objects


Spring Application:
   The application is written in java technology, executed on Spring Container which is runtime for spring applications.spring container runs on jvm

        //create dependencies object
        ProductRepository productRepository = new ProductRepository();
        ProductService productService = new ProductService(productRepository);
        //productService.setProductRepository(productRepository);
        ProductController productController = new ProductController(productService);

        productController.findProducts().stream().forEach(product -> {
            System.out.println(product);

Spring Bean is Java Object follows Bean Specification and also managemented by Spring Container.

.............................................................................................
				   Spring Bean Creation(Object)
.............................................................................................

Who creates Spring Beans?

 -Spring Container

 Spring container is java object, which manages object(bean) life cycle like   create,use,destroy.

How spring beans are created?

-> you must have bean definitions outside application biz logic
-> sp container reads that bean definitions, initalizes the beans.

Architecture:

			POJO Classes(Bean)
				 |
    Spring-Application <====>SpringContainer
      config file		 |
		       Fullyconfigured System


Spring Bean Definitions(file) instructs Spring Container how to create objects(order of creations) and how to link (DI) objects
.....................................................................................
			Spring Application Configuration Managment
....................................................................................

Spring Application can be configured in many ways

1.XML files  -  Old and Legacy.

2.Java Config + Annotations

2.1 Java Config -Manual - Write Configuration and logic

 Here Dev need to write Configuration and biz logic , which makes app dev slower.

Just Focus logic, automate configuration itself - AutoConfig

3.AutoConfig:
    Framework must take care of configuration based on various condtions like
 i want web and jpa , messaging.
                        "Birth of Spring Boot"

.....................................................................................
			 Annotations
.....................................................................................

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/

What is Annotations?
Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

Annotation is a code which is injected into another code.

Annotation code can be injected 

at source code level -  annotation code will be available only in source code
@override

at compile time - only uses compiler

at runtime - available in compile time and runtime both

Spring Project Setup 
			    

What are the required components to setup Spring Project.

1.IDE,mvn,java

2.Project layout


Spring Project requires

Infra Structure:
 1.Project libraries

 2.Project Configurations

Application Structure

1.Application code
2.assets - imgs,docs
3.App Configuration

mvn or gradel
...................................................................................
				    Spring Project Creations
....................................................................................

Types of Spring Project

1.Spring core - DI features
2.Spring Web - 
   Web Apps (RESTFull WebServices)
3.Spring Data

What is Rest api?
 Rest api is api which delivers data to the web clients via http in the form of json.


eg: Simple Bean /object creation and DI

package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //SpringContainer Object Reference
        ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
        //Object is created by springContainer , you are getting reference only
        Greeter greeter = context.getBean(Greeter.class);
        System.out.println(greeter.sayGreet());

        //
        ProductService productService =context.getBean(ProductService.class);
        System.out.println(productService.findAll());


    }

}
package com.example.demo;


import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Greeter {
    public String sayGreet() {
        return "Hello Spring!";
    }
}
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.List;

@Component
public class ProductService {

    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    public ProductService(ProductRepository productRepository) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    public List<String> findAll() {
        return  productRepository.findAll();
    }
}
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.List;

@Component
public class ProductRepository {

    public List<String> findAll(){
        return List.of("Java","Spring","Boot");
    }
}
